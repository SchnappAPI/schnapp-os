> 🔴 **Leak still in force for SECRECY:** every PRE-2026-06-22 vault value was dumped in
> `obsidian-vault` Claude-export files + synced to OneDrive → compromised. **Rotated so far:** the
> **SA token** (2026-06-22, below) and **all 3 MCP bearers** (`MAC_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`,
> `GITHUB_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, `OP_MCP_BEARER` — 2026-06-23, Phase 3B). **Still compromised → owner-console
> rotation outstanding:** `GITHUB_PAT`, Anthropic API key, Claude OAuth, DB `sa`, Web App secrets
> (incl. `RUNNER_API_KEY`), Webshare, Cloudflare. See [[credential-leak-2026-06-17]].

**VAULT FLATTEN — Phase A done 2026-06-26 (owner-directed, overrides the 0011 deferral; flatten-only, NO rotation).**
Created 10 split items in `web-variables`, values COPIED from the bundles: `ADMIN_PASSCODE`,
`ADMIN_REFRESH_CODE`, `AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `ODDS_API_KEY`, `RUNNER_API_KEY`, `SQL_CONNECTION_STRING`
(← `Web App`); `WEB_APP_CONFIG` (non-secret config, Secure Note); `MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD` (← `Database`);
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (← `Anthropic/api_key`); `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (← `Claude Code/oauth_token`).
All resolve. **Old bundles untouched → nothing broken.** `schnapp-os/.env.template` +
`obsidian-mcp/README.md` repointed to the new items. **`ADMIN_REFRESH_CODE` copied as only 2 chars —
owner to sanity-check source.** Confirmed via `updated_at` (all bundles 2026-05, pre-leak) that the
copied values are STILL the leaked ones — flatten does not rotate; rotation backlog below stands.
**Phase B+C DONE 2026-06-26.** Repointed every consumer (verified) then deleted the bundles.
Repointed+pushed: schnapp-bet (`c626196`: .env.template+9 workflows+docs, 23 refs), obsidian-vault,
schnapp-os. Repointed-not-committed: `web-bad` (stale local clone of schnapp-bet's remote — workflows
don't run from it). Edited on disk: **brain-watcher's `OneDrive/Obsidian/.github/.env.template`** (a
SEPARATE file from `~/code/obsidian-vault` — different inode — would've broken brain-agent if missed;
the repo grep alone does NOT catch it). Deleted (after 0-ref grep guard across all repos+OneDrive):
`Web App`, `Anthropic`, `Claude Code`, `MCP Tokens`, `GitHub`; removed `Database/mssql_sa_password`
field. `Database` core {server,database,username,password,trust_cert} kept → ~18 ETL workflows
unchanged. **Verified: vault=27 items, all new refs + Database core resolve, 5 bundles not-found.**
**ROTATION STILL OWED** — flatten copied values, did not rotate; the leak banner's outstanding set
(GITHUB_PAT, Anthropic key, Claude OAuth, DB sa, Web App secrets, Webshare, Cloudflare) stands, now as
discrete items. Where-to-change detail: [credentials-map](../credentials-map.md) changelog (2026-06-26).
Mac vault writes this session ran via **MacOS-MCP `Shell` + `zsh -lic`** (loads the SA token from the
login profile); the `mac-mcp` op_run/op_whoami connector is still `unauthorized` (dead client bearer,
below) — irrelevant, the shell path works.

**SA TOKEN ROTATED 2026-06-22 (Phase 1 done).** Old SA `VU2RKR2IDZB6TCAKQRK7J2W5EE` is **deleted**
(any old token now returns `403 Forbidden — Service Account Deleted`). New SA integration
`55TZDNGRIFGMBPALL6ZEWLH7Q4`, vault `web-variables`, token len 852 / last4 `bSJ9`. Note: owner
rotated the SA token **in place** (replaced the value in the existing 1Password item), not an additive
"mint alongside". The prior token now returns `403 Service Account Deleted` and `op whoami`'s
integration id changed (`VU2RK…`→`55TZ…`). So there was **no zero-downtime window**: every surface on
the old token broke the moment the rotation took effect, until propagated. The rotation *is* the
revoke — there is no separate revoke step.

Propagated to: `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zshenv` (**UNQUOTED** — see op-wrap gotcha), the launchd session env
(via the `com.schnapp.environment` run-once agent, which `. ~/.zshenv && launchctl setenv …`),
**11 GH repo secrets** (obsidian-vault, schnapp-bet, schnapp-os, appfolio-quickbase-sync, schnapp-kit,
claude-skills, sports-modeling, appfolio-mcp, ref-vault, af-invoice-parser, af-query-api), and the
**Render `op-mcp`** env + redeploy (owner). All 6 launchd services restarted and **healthy** on the
new token: macmcp / githubmcp / obsidian-mcp / brain-watcher + bet.schnapp web-prod (HTTP 200) / flask.
Verified: shell `op whoami` = 55TZ; Render `op_health` = authenticated. The plist
`com.schnapp.environment` holds **no** token (it sources `~/.zshenv`), so rotation needs no plist edit.

**🔑 op-wrap UNQUOTED gotcha (new 2026-06-22):** `~/code/schnapp-bet/services/launchd/op-wrap.sh`
(every launchd service boots through it) does **not** source `~/.zshrc` — it `grep`s the
`export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=` line and strips the prefix **literally**
(`${LINE#export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=}`). So the token in `~/.zshrc` MUST be **unquoted**.
Writing it quoted (`='ops_…'`) makes op-wrap export the value WITH the quote chars → every service
fails op-client init with `failed to DeserializeServiceAccountAuthToken, unrecognized auth type` and
crash-loops (exit 1). Sourcing readers (zsh, the env agent) strip the quotes fine, so the shell +
session env look healthy while services die — misleading. Keep the token unquoted in both files.
[[op-wrap-token-unquoted]]

**ROTATION GOTCHA (still in force):** after ANY SA rotation the long-running launchd services cache
the old token in-process → restart them (`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/<label>`), re-run
`com.schnapp.environment` to refresh the launchd session env, AND update Render `op-mcp` env +
redeploy. Else `op_*` keeps failing though `~/.zshrc` is correct.

**MCP bearers ROTATED 2026-06-23 (Phase 3B).** All three leaked bearers minted fresh
(`openssl rand -hex 32`, non-echoing) and verified on the Mac side:
- `MAC_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` → restarted `com.schnapp.macmcp`; `:8765` new bearer 200 / bogus 401. (The old
  `…6267` value — the one this/earlier sessions' Mac MCP tools presented as `unauthorized` — is now dead.)
- `GITHUB_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` → restarted `com.schnapp.githubmcp`; `:8766` new bearer 200 / bogus 401.
- `OP_MCP_BEARER` → owner propagated Render env (+redeploy) + Cloudflare portal Custom header; `op_health`
  authenticated; origin `/mcp` new bearer 200 / bogus 401. (Clients reach the portal over **OAuth** — no
  static client bearer to rotate on Mac/claude.ai/iPhone.)

**Owner CLIENT legs still pending (don't break anything; just refresh the client to the new value):**
- claude.ai connector `mac-mcp.schnapp.bet` Authorization Bearer = `op://web-variables/MAC_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN/credential`.
- Copilot / github-mcp client bearer = `op://web-variables/GITHUB_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN/credential`.

**Found mid-3B (Mac infra, not the SA):** (a) deployed `~/{mac,github,obsidian}-mcp/server.py` symlinked
the **dead** `~/code/claude-kit/*` path (Phase 2 rename residual) — repointed to `~/code/schnapp-os/*`
before any restart (else all three crash-loop). (b) `com.schnapp.macmcp.plist` had been clobbered to a
bare JSON array (no `Label`/`WorkingDirectory`) → reboot would run macmcp **unauthed/exposed** — rewrote
as a proper secrets-free op-wrap `<dict>` (not reloaded; running job healthy). (c) plaintext-secrets
backup `…macmcp.plist.bak.20260524` holds the dead MAC bearer + live `GH_PAT`/`RUNNER_API_KEY` → owner
`rm` + those two join the console-rotation set. `gh`/GitHub auth is independent of the SA and unaffected.

GitHub Actions: `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` set on all 11 repos 2026-06-22 (not yet exercised by a real
run post-rotation). `DB_Storage` + `appfolio-marketing-project` still lack it (owner decision pending).
